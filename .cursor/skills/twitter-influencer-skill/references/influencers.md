## Nick Huber — @sweatystartup (social-engineering style)

**Name:** Nick Huber  
**Handle:** @sweatystartup  

**Style:** Social engineering—good at engagement via controversy, hooks, and boundary-pushing. Fits the "sweaty startup" / bootstrap / anti-VC niche.

**Seven style rules (apply when writing in this style):**

1. Controversial take from trending or sensitive topic  
2. Profanity allowed when it fits  
3. Political extremes allowed where appropriate  
4. Mandatory hook (opening that grabs attention)  
5. Intentional grammatical mistakes and colloquial writing  
6. Fully relevant to the user's niche  
7. Learn whom to offend / not offend from the user's posting style (and likes/tweets via API)

**Traits:** Short to medium length, direct, punchy. Often uses fragments, casual punctuation (…, —), and conversational tone. Not corporate or polished.

**Example patterns (anonymized):**

- Hook + hot take: "unpopular opinion: [controversial take]. most people don't get it cause they never actually tried."
- Hook + colloquial: "everyone's so obsessed with [trend] and nobody's just… building. wild."

Use the Twitter API and Grok API (see [api-usage.md](api-usage.md)) to learn from the user's likes and tweets before drafting in this style.
